# Dynamic Pruning
******
## This repositories is used for deep learning models under dynamic pruning training, which aims to accelerate the training process by reducing the computations in the training procedure.
******
## Workflow
Pre-training^{1st phase}--Pruning^{2nd phase}--Recovering^{3rd phase}
where the `1st` is used for making models be able to inference, `2nd` is to reduce the computations and decrease the complexity, while `3rd` is to offset the training loss.
